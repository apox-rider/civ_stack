</p>

CivStack is a dual-discipline startup that fuses classical **structural & civil engineering** with modern **AI, IoT, digital twins, and full-stack software** to solve humanity's most pressing physical challenges:

- Safe & resilient **Shelter**  
- Efficient & climate-smart **Food production**  
- Circular & sustainable **Clothing & materials** systems  

We build **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)** in 2026–2028 that are practical, affordable, and impactful — especially in emerging and vulnerable communities.

## 🎯 Our North Star

> Technology must serve physical reality and not replace it.

### Mission (2026–2028)
Create scalable, accessible engineering + software solutions that:
- Reduce housing costs and increase disaster resilience by 30–40% through AI-powered design & effective monitoring  
- Improve food security in water-scarce regions with smart structural + irrigation systems powered organized teams and systems. 
- Transform agricultural waste into high-value textile materials via circular supply chain platforms  

### Long-term Vision (2035)
A world where:
- Every new building is disaster-resilient by intelligent default  
- Farming communities have predictive, offline-capable smart infrastructure  
- 20+ million tons of agricultural waste become sustainable clothing fabric annually  
- All powered by transparent, blockchain-enabled micro-financing & open technology stacks

## Core Focus Areas

| Area       | Problem We Solve                              | Our Approach                                      | Key Technologies                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Shelter**   | 1.2B+ people need safe, affordable housing    | AI-driven BIM, digital twins, structural health monitoring | BIM, IoT sensors, AI optimization    |
| **Food**      | Water scarcity + climate volatility           | Smart irrigation, vertical farming structures, predictive yield models | IoT automation, predictive AI, hydroponics |
| **Clothing**  | Massive agricultural waste & linear fashion   | GIS-mapped circular supply chains, waste-to-textile platforms | Material simulation, blockchain tracking |

## Guiding Principles

- **Impact First** — real-world human & environmental benefit over hype  
- **Engineering Rigor** — physics and building codes are sacred  
- **Radical Accessibility** — solutions built for emerging markets, offline-first, affordable  

## The Team

- **Innocent** — Civil Engineering Lead  
  Structural integrity • Seismic design • Sustainable materials • Construction standards  

- **Avith** — Technology Lead  
  AI integration • IoT systems • Full-stack development • Digital twins  

Two minds. One obsession: making the physical world safer, fairer, and more sustainable.

## Current Status (January 2026)

- Early-stage MVP development  
- Focus: Shelter resilience tools + basic smart irrigation prototypes  
- Preparing for first field pilots in East Africa (2026–2027)  
- Building open-source components where appropriate  

## Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Frontend: Next.js / React / Tailwind CSS  
- Backend: Node.js / Python (AI & data pipelines)  
- AI/ML: PyTorch, custom structural models  
- IoT & Sensors: Integration layer in development  
- Infrastructure: Vercel / AWS / Digital Ocean (TBD)
